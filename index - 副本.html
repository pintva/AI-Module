            <p>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence
                demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
                Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive"
                functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>

            <h3 class="detail-title">Digital Prototype</h3>
            <p>Digital Prototyping gives conceptual design, engineering, manufacturing, and sales and marketing
                departments the ability to virtually explore a complete product before itâ€™s built. Industrial designers,
                manufacturers, and engineers use Digital Prototyping to design, iterate, optimize, validate, and
                visualize their products digitally throughout the product development process. Innovative digital
                prototypes can be created via CAutoD through intelligent and near-optimal iterations, meeting multiple
                design objectives (such as maximised output, energy efficiency, highest speed and cost-effectiveness),
                identifying multiple figures of merit, and reducing development gearing and time-to-market. Marketers
                also use Digital Prototyping to create photorealistic renderings and animations of products prior to
                manufacturing. Companies often adopt Digital Prototyping with the goal of improving communication
                between product development stakeholders, getting products to market faster, and facilitating product
                innovation.</p>

            <h3 class="detail-title">CAD</h3>
            <p>Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computers (or workstations) to aid in the creation,
                modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. CAD software is used to increase the
                productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through
                documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing. CAD output is often in the form of
                electronic files for print, machining, or other manufacturing operations. The term CADD (for Computer
                Aided Design and Drafting) is also used.</p>

            <h3 class="detail-title">CAE</h3>
            <p>Computer-aided engineering (CAE) is the broad usage of computer software to aid in engineering analysis
                tasks. It includes finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), multibody dynamics
                (MBD), durability and optimization.</p>

            <h3 class="detail-title">Virtual Prototype</h3>
            <p>Virtual prototyping is a method in the process of product development. It involves using computer-aided
                design (CAD), computer-automated design (CAutoD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software to
                validate a design before committing to making a physical prototype. This is done by creating (usually
                3D) computer generated geometrical shapes (parts) and either combining them into an "assembly" and
                testing different mechanical motions, fit and function. The assembly or individual parts could be opened
                in CAE software to simulate the behavior of the product in the real world.</p>

            <h3 class="detail-title">VR</h3>
            <p>Virtual reality (VR) is an experience taking place within simulated and immersive environments that can
                be similar to or completely different from the real world. Applications of virtual reality can include
                entertainment (i.e. gaming) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other,
                distinct types of VR style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality.</p>
            <h3 class="detail-title">AR</h3>
            <p>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that
                reside in the real-world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across
                multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.The
                overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or
                destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment).</p>

            <h3 class="detail-title">Physical Prototype</h3>
            <p>Physical Prototyping is the process of making a physical representation of an idea. Early in the process
                physical prototypes can be made of all kinds of materials. Physical prototypes allow the designer and
                users to interact with the idea.</p>
